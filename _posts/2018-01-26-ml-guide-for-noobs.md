# Machine Learning ü§ñü§ùüë®üèª‚Äçüè´

Machine learning is a field which deals with training computers to learn behaviors using some form of data.
A very simple and naive analogy that can be expressed to describe how machine learning works is through introspection of how humans get better in understanding life; it's through knowledge which in essence is nothing but data. A human brain is able to digest data, churn it up and use it as experiences to best anticipate the responses to any stimuli. Machine learning is the same process but for machines which at the moment can be treated as a brain of a toddler.

As a Machine Learning professional/student, the most important thing to note is that just like how when you communicate with a toddler one has to dumb things down to a level that the toddler could first form a basic understanding of what the topic of discussion is, the same way training data has to be dumbed down for the machine incredibly before posing a task/problem to the machine.

In more formal words, Preprocessing the data that we want the machine to train on should be the first priority in any ML task. Its only after we have cleaned and filtered the data we want the machine to learn that we can move forward with the real science and talk to the machine about various mathematical models.

Now obviously since we don't want to re-invent the wheel of creating a language to communicate with our machines, lets list out the tech stack that we will need to move forward in this journey.

My programming language of choice is Python, specifically Python 3, we'll use the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) which is a collection of various data science and machine learning libraries for python.

In the next post I'll talk more about the Preprocessing phase with some python code examples.
