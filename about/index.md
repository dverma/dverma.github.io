##Hi!

Welcome to Dhawal Verma's place on the interwebs.
I'm a Software Engineer by profession, who happens to love football, music and traveling.
I'm also passionate about learning guitar, different styles of architecture and different technologies.

This blog is mostly for my thoughts and findings that I ponder upon while I explore anything and/or to keep notes.
